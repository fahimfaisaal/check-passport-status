# Check Passport Status (Minimal Script)

This script allows you to easily check the current status of your applied passport with just a single command. To get started, make sure you have all the required dependencies installed by using `yarn` or `npm`.

## Installation

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn # or npm install
```

## How to Run

Before running the script, you need to set your `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` inside the `.env` file, similar to the format provided in `example.env`.

Once you have set the necessary environment variables, execute the script using the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

The script will run, and you will receive the output directly in the terminal where you executed the command. This output will contain the current status of your applied passport.
